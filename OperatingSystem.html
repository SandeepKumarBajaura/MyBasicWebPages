    <h1><b>What is an Operating System?</b></h1><hr/>
    <p><b>An operating system</b> is an <b>system software</b>. that acts as an <u>interface</u> between <u><b>software and diffrent part of 
    computer or the computer hardware</b></u>. <br/> Every computer must have at least one operating sytem to run other
    <b><u>program, applications</u></b> like: <b>browser, MS office, Notepad</b> etc. need some enviroment to run and perform its task. </p>
    <ul>
        <li> operating system helps you to <b>communicate</b> with the computer without knowing how to speak the 
            <b>computer's language.</b> it is not posible for the user to use any <u>computer or mobile device</u> without having
            an <b>operating system.</b>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><u><b>Why Operating Systems used?</b></u></h2>
    <p>Operating System is used as a communication channel between the <u>Computer hardware and the user</u>. 
    It works as an intermediate<b> between System Hardware and End-User</b>.<br/>
    <h3>Operating System handles the following responsibilities:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It controls all the computer resources.</li>
        <li>It provides valuable services to user programs.</li>
        <li>It provides resources for user programs.</li>
        <li>It provides an interface (virtual machine) to the user.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr/>
    <h2><u>Functions / Task of operating system.</u></h2>
    <ol>
            <li>Processor Management</li>
            <li>Memory Management</li>
            <li>Device Management</li>
            <li>File Management</li>
            <li>Security</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><u>1. Processor Management: </u></h2>
    <p>In a <u>multi-programming environment</u>, the OS(Operating System) decides the order in which <b>processes</b> have access to the processor,
     and<b> how much processing time</b> each process has. This function of OS is called <b>Process Management.</b></p>
     
    <li><b><u>What is Process: </u></b></li>
     <p>A processs is an <b>instance of a program</b> running in a computer. A term used in some operating system, In <b>unix
        and some other operating system</b> a process is stored when a program is initiated. </p>

    <h3><u>Process State: </u></h3>
    <p><b>Process state</b> in operating system are way to <u>manage resources</u> efficiently by keeping track of the current <b>state</b>
        of each process.
    </p>
    <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>The states of process are as follows:</u> </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>New</li>
        <li>Ready</li>
        <li>Running</li>
        <li>Waiting</li>
        <li>Terminated</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><u>2. Memory Management: </u></h2>
    <p>The operating system manages the <b>Primary Memory or Main Memory</b>. <u>Main memory</u> is made up of a large array
    of <b>bytes or words</b> where each byte or word is assigned a <b>certain address</b>. Main memory is fast <u>storage</u> and it 
    can be accessed directly by the CPU<b>(Central Processing Unit).</b></p>
    <h3><u>An operating system perform following activities for memory management: </u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It keeps track of primary memory, i.e., which bytes of memory are used by which user program. The memory addresses that have already been allocated and the memory addresses of the memory that has not yet been used. </li>
        <li>In multiprogramming, the OS decides the order in which processes are granted memory access, and for how long. </li>
        <li>It Allocates the memory to a process when the process requests it and deallocates the memory when the process has terminated or is performing an I/O operation. </li>
    </ul><hr/>
    <h2><u>Types of operating system: </u></h2>
    <p><b>Followings are the popular types of operating system: </b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Batch operating system</li>
        <li>Multi-Tasking / Time sharing operating system</li>
        <li>Multi-processing operating system</li>
        <li>Real-Time operating system</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Hard Real-Time System</li>
                <li>Soft Real-Time System</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Distributed Operating system</li>
        <li>Network operating system</li>
        <li>mobile operating system</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><u>1. Batch Operating system: </u></h2>
    <p>This type of <b>operating system </b> not interact with the <u>computer directly</u>. There is an <u>operator</u> which
     takes similar jobs having the same requirements and groups them into batches. It is the responsibility of
     the operator to sort jobs with similar needs. <b>Batch Operating System</b> is designed to <u>manage and execute</u> a large 
     number of jobs efficiently by processing them in groups
    </p>
    <h3>Advantage of Batch Operating system</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Multiple users can share the batch systems.</li>
        <li>It is easy to manage large work repeatedly in batch systems.</li>
        <li>The idle time for the batch system is very less.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Disadvantage of Batch operating system</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>CPU is not used efficiently.</b> <em>(When the current process is doing IO, CPU is free and could be utilized by other processes waiting)</em>.</li>
        <li>The other jobs will have to wait for an unknown time if any job fails.</li>
        <li> average response time increases as all processes are processed one by one.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><u>2. Multitasking / Time-sharing Operating system</u></h2>
    <p><b>Multitasking Operating Systems</b> can be simply illustrated as more than <u>program</u> is present in the
    <u> main memory </u> any one of them can be kept in execution. This is basically used for better <b>Utilization</b>
    of resources.</p>
    <h3> Advantage of Multitasking operating system</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>CPU is better utilized and overall performance of the system improves.</li>
        <li>It helps in reducing the response time.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><u>3. Multi-Processing Operating system</u></h2>
    <p><b><u>Multi-Processing Operating System</u></b> in which more than one CPU is used for the execution of resources. It betters the <u>throughput</u> of the System.</p>
    <h3>Advantage of Multi-Processing Operating System</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It increases the <b><u>throughput</u></b> of the system as processes can be parallelized.</li>
        <li>As it has <u><b>several processors</b></u>, so, if one processor fails, we can proceed with another processor</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><u>4. Real-Time Operating System</u></h2>
    <p>These types of OSs serve real-time systems. The time interval required to process and respond to inputs is very small. This time interval is called <b>response time.Real-time systems</b> </p>
    <h2><u>Define Types of Real-Time O.S.</u></h2>
    <h3>(i) Hard Real-Time systems: </h3>
    <p>Hard Real-Time OSs are meant for applications where time constraints are very strict and even the shortest possible delay is not acceptable. These systems are built for saving life like automatic parachutes or airbags which are required to be readily available in case of an accident. Virtual memory is rarely found in these systems.</p>
    <h3>(ii) Soft Real-Time System: </h3>
    <p>These Operating system are for applications where time-constraint is less <b>strict.</b></p>
    <h3><u>Advantage of Real-time Operating system</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <b>
        <li>Maximmum Consumption</li>
        <li>Task Shifting</li>
        <li>Focus on applications</li>
        <li>Error Free</li>
        <li>Memory allocation</li>
        </b>
    </ul>
    <h2><u>5. Distributed Operating System</u></h2>
    <p>A distributed operating system is a system that <b>connects multiple computers through a single communication</b>
     channel to work together to serve applications. </p>
     <h3><u>Advantage of Distributed operating system</u></h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Improved performance. </li>
        <li>Increased reliability. </li>
        <li>Enhanced resource sharing. </li>
        <li>Flexibility and accessibility.
        <i>(Distributed systems can be accessed from different locations and devices. )</i></li>
     </ol>
